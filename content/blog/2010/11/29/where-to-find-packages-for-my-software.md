If for some inexplicable reason anybody would like to check out any of my
software in Ubuntu, just add my PPA:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ilkka/myppa

There's not much there but I'll try to push releases there on a regular basis,
to get a hang of the workflow if for nothing else.

<ins>There's also a snapshot ppa with, yes, snapshot versions, at
`ppa:ilkka/snapshot`.</ins>
